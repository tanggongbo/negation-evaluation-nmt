In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long.

The state university workers" most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work. The pay disparities alone are shocking. About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). Meanwhile, university presidents" annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million. While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.

As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, "I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve." Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: "I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise - a living wage."

As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel. "There is an unwritten class system at the universities," Fulmer said. "And we are at the bottom of it."

It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. Lord knows that something's gotta give.

Most US cinemas have banned masks, face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which happened during a screening of another Batman flick, "The Dark Knight Rises." The gunman wore a Joker costume when he went on a gun and tear-gas rampage, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Body costumes that don't hide a person's identity, however, have been generally allowed in theaters.

Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, which in the past were allies of the USSR, have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse. In response to Russia's actions, they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region, writes The Times. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. An Eurofighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets. Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast, is also concerned about Russia's aspirations. It is not a member of the alliance, but is involved in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was "preparing" Georgia for accession. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014.

He got trounced anyway, losing emphatically to Mr. Zelensky, whose own officials quickly became the Trump team's new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden.

That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly bemusement in Ukraine.

Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas, known as Himiko, which was found previously by the Subaru Telescope in 2009. "It is reasonable to find a protocluster near a massive object, such as Himiko. However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center." said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, "It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center. These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies."

Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period would make any difference for those women.

Questioned about the study, Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco, agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with. But she noted that the study did not find that Utah's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women.

Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma

In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.

Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings. The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea. There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.

First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe." Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?

As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.

That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur. In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence. In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.

I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?

Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bedlam in the UK lends itself to delay without decisions. Lawmakers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson's hands and seek an extension, but that's about all they can agree on. This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May's hard-fought Brexit deal with the EU three times. Unless there's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won't change.

But even an election is a grim prospect for European capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit policy is a painful contortion act that's almost impossible to understand; the centrist Liberal Democrats' idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme. The longer this drags on, the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the EU.
