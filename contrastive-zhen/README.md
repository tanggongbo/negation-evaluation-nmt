we create a contrastive evaluation set for negation on EN->ZH, using the development and test sets from the WMT shared translation task 2017--2020. The contrastive evaluation set also has two sub-categories: negation deletion and negation insertion. 

We first select the five most popular Chinese negation cues -- "bu", "mei", "wu", "fei", and "bie" (不,没,无,非,别). Then, we manually delete the negation cue from the reference or insert a negation cue into the reference, without affecting the grammaticality. The negation deletion and negation insertion categories have 2,005 and 3,062 sets with contrastive translations, respectively. 

For each contrastive translation pair, the first target sentence is the reference, and the remaining target sentences are contrastive translations. 

run the following commands for evaluation: 

    python3 evaluate.py -s example_scores/score.add -l data/list.group.add # 99.02
    python3 evaluate.py -s example_scores/score.del -l data/list.group.del # 92.07
    
Note: "score.add" and "score.del" are generated by the Sockeye toolkit. 

The files list.group.add/del, which provide the number of sentences in each pair, are generated by running: 

    cat neg.add.en | uniq -c | cut -d" " -f7 >list.group.add
    cat neg.del.en | uniq -c | cut -d" " -f7 >list.group.del
